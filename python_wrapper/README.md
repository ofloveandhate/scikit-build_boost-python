These are the pure-python bindings for the `example` library.

`example` is a wrapper around a compiled C++ set of bindings, which expose functions from a C++ core library.  You need all three components installed for the setup to work.  They are designed to be separately buildable and installable, while also being installable all-at-once.  At this level, these are just the pure-python wrappers.
